# Mini Challenge Eight to Ten - Endpoints

**Description:** Design an API that has three endpoints. Each endpoint has their own Controller file in the Controller folder. Each endpoint has their own Services file in the Service folder. The endpoints are as followed:

1. Magic 8 Ball: create a endpoint generates 8 unique responses. One controller


2. Guess It: create 3 endpoints (one controller) that takes an input, then outputs if the number is higher or lower than the number guessed.
Easy Mode 1-10
Medium Mode 1-50
Hard Mode 1-100

3. Restaurant Picker: create 1 endpoint that takes an input and generates a Randomly Generated Restaurant based on the category chosen. 10 Restaurants per category.

**Comments:** Everything runs correctly and your code looks good. I like how you did the restaurant picker with an array instead of how I did it with a switch statement, because it looks much easier and faster to code. Great work!
